		<p>1. What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?</p>
		<p>Semantic tags help organize and define the page. It helps distinguish between what is important, what is less important, a table, a figure, a footer etc. I think the article tag is useful because it indicates independant content on the page. The nav tag is also important because it indicates a section where navagations links are provided</p>
		<p>2. What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?</p>
		<p>The browser will display elements top to bottom. </p>
		<p>3. What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?</p>
		<p>Sublime snippets help make make code reusable and make it easy to navigate to. Sublime has other shortcuts like html[TAB] which helps with getting the basic layout of an html page which is very handy, since html pages have this same basic structure.Yes, I think I will make snippets again, especially if I see code that I will need to use often.</p>
		<p>4. What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?</p>
		<p>Rowspan and Colspan are still hard concepts. I can practice making more tables using these two attributes.</p>
