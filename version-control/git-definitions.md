# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is something that helps us see the entire timeline of revisions made to one or more files. Version control allows us to merge revisions made by different people.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a copy of a project that you can work on. You would use a branch to change something in a file and then you can merge it back into the master branch. This way, you can preserve the clean condition of the master branch.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a save point in Git that you can refer back to in the future, if needed. A good commit message will be specific in describing what has changed since the last commit.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict is when individuals working on the same file make different changes to the same line of code and try to merge their branches into the master branch, Git will not know which one is correct.
