##Key Design Philosophies of Linux Operating System

* Linux assumes you know what you are doing and does anything you tell it to do.

* Make Every Program A Filter
Each command will filter the data by making some change to the data for the next command to use.
* Small Is Beautiful And Each Program Does One Thing Well 
Each command performs a specific task and is very fast because it only does that one thing.
* Choose Portability Over Efficiency And Use Shell Scripts to Increase Leveage And Portability. 
Portable shell scrips are more efficient beause it can run on even incompatible systems.
* Use Software Leverage
Leverage work of other programmers so we can use for command line commands in place of 7000 lines of code. 
* Prototype as Soon as Possible
* Store Data in Flat Text Files
* Avoid Captive User Interfaces

* Open Source - source code of software that is free and anyone can download, modify and redistribute. Code can evolve because the development community wants to make good software and not just so they can make money.

##What is a VPS (virtual private server)?
Virtual machine that is on the Internet and acts like an operating system. 

##What is the advantage of using a VPS?
They are cheaper than an actual physical server. You can start a VPS that costs very little for a small amount of space (ssd) and speed (cpu) and then pay more as you need it.  

##Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as a root user on a Linux system?
Running program as root user makes your program easier to hack and if you get a virus, it can destroy your whole program so for security reasons, only use root for administrative tasks.
