1. Display the information in one table (either table is fine).

sqlite> SELECT * FROM tvshow;

1|This is Us
2|Superstore

2. Update an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

sqlite> UPDATE actors SET age=39 WHERE actor="Sterling Brown";

3. Display the information in both tables using one query.

sqlite> SELECT * FROM actors, tvshow WHERE actors.tvshow_id = tvshow.id;

1|Milo Ventimiglia|39|false|1|1|This is Us
2|Mandy Moore|32|true|1|1|This is Us
3|Lauren Ash|33|true|2|2|Superstore
4|Sterling Brown|39|false|1|1|This is Us
5|Ben Feldman|36|false|2|2|Superstore
6|Chrissy Metz|36|true|1|1|This is Us
7|America Ferrera|32|true|2|2|Superstore
8|Justin Hartley|39|false|1|1|This is Us

4. Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) from both tables using one query.

sqlite> SELECT actors.actor, actors.age, tvshow.show_name FROM actors JOIN tvshow ON actors.tvshow_id = tvshow.id;

Milo Ventimiglia|39|This is Us
Mandy Moore|32|This is Us
Lauren Ash|33|Superstore
Sterling Brown|39|This is Us
Ben Feldman|36|Superstore
Chrissy Metz|36|This is Us
America Ferrera|32|Superstore
Justin Hartley|39|This is Us

5. Delete an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

sqlite> DELETE FROM actors WHERE actor="Justin Hartley" AND age=39;
