2. You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

sqlite> SELECT *  FROM businesses JOIN users JOIN reviews ON businesses.id = reviews.business_id AND users.id = reviews.user_id;

1|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|4|Steven|Wonder|1|5|Good food!|1|4
4|Lotus Yoga|3|Angela|Jolie|2|1|I broke my leg|4|3
1|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|1|Bradford|Pitt|3|-1|I was poisoned!|1|1
2|Amir's Towing|2|Mandy|Kaling|4|3|It was okay.|2|2

3. There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

sqlite> SELECT businesses.name, users.firstname, users.lastname, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM businesses JOIN users JOIN reviews ON businesses.id = reviews.business_id AND users.id = reviews.user_id;

Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|Steven|Wonder|5|Good food!
Lotus Yoga|Angela|Jolie|1|I broke my leg
Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|Bradford|Pitt|-1|I was poisoned!
Amir's Towing|Mandy|Kaling|3|It was okay.

4. How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business? 

sqlite> SELECT businesses.name, users.firstname, users.lastname, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM businesses JOIN users JOIN reviews ON businesses.id = reviews.business_id AND users.id = reviews.user_id AND businesses.name = "Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel";

Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|Steven|Wonder|5|Good food!
Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|Bradford|Pitt|-1|I was poisoned!
